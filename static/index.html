				<h2>Try Scouts!</h2>
				<p>Interested in trying out Scouting? Why not bring your child down
					to our hall and let them see just how much fun Scouting can be!</p>
					
				<p style="padding-left: 20em">Joeys (6-8 years):  Mondays 6pm - 7pm</p>
				<p style="padding-left: 20em">Cubs (8-11 years):  Wednesdays 7pm - 8.30pm</p>
				<p style="padding-left: 20em">Scouts (11-15 years): Thursdays 7pm - 9pm</p>

				<h3>How do I get my child to try Scouting?</h3>
				<p>All you need to do is bring your child to the weekly meeting of the relevant Section (i.e. Joeys, Cubs or Scouts).
					It&apos;s that simple! You can try out Scouting for FREE for up to 4 weeks, allowing your child
					to try different activities before they decide if they want to join up.</p>

				<h3>What can they wear?</h3>
				<p>Comfortable and casual clothing is recommended.  Once your child decides to join up, they will need to wear a uniform. 
				It is important that they wear enclosed shoes. Thongs, sandals and Crocs are not permitted.</p>

				<h3>Can I stay with my child and watch?</h3>
				<p>Yes, of course you can! Particularly with the younger children (e.g. Joeys), parents
					often stay and even help with the activities.</p>
				
				<h3>What if my child doesn&apos;t like Scouting?</h3>
				<p>We always suggest trying us out for a couple of weeks. In the (unlikely!) event
					that your child decides that Scouting isn&apos;t for them, you simply don&apos;t bring them
					back. There is no obligation to join up just because they come down to the hall to try it out.</p>

				<h3>Where can I find more information?</h3>
				<p>When you come to our hall a Leader will talk to you, answer any questions you might have and give
					you one of our New Members Information packs.  Please contact George Murray, Group Leader, on 02 9667 1065.</p>
