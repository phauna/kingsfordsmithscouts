						<h2>Cubs: Do your best</h2>
					
						<p>Cub Scouts are girls and boys between the ages of 7&#189; and 10&#189; who set off together on an exciting trail of adventure.</p>
						<p>A group of Cub Scouts is known as a "Pack".  Cub Packs are led by a team of trained adult volunteers whose Scouting names are taken from 
						Rudyard Kipling's "Jungle Book". Within the Pack are smaller groups called Sixes, each led by a Cub Scout Sixer and assisted by a Second.</p>
						<p>Cubs can earn a number of different badges to wear on their uniform or display on their camp blanket. 
						We particularly encourage our Cubs to work on their <a href="../Cubs/BronzeBoomerang.html">Boomerang Awards</a> 
						and <a href="../Cubs/Cubs_Achievement.html">Achievement badges</a>, 
						for them to acquire new skills they&apos;ll find useful in Scouting.</p>
						
						<h3>What do we do?</h3>
						<p>Our Cubs enjoy many different activites every year.  Cub meetings are often held away from the hall and include activities such as
						 indoor rock climbing, laser tag or visiting the police or fire station. We also practice our fire lighting (and singing) with campfires at the hall.  
						 In Summer we have a meeting at the pool and work on our swimming badges. Our whole group camps together 
						 yearly so that the Joeys, Cubs and Scouts can get to know one another but we have our own Pack Holidays too.  There are also the Cub Region Camp and the 
						 <a href="http://smscouts.roundtablesoftware.com.au/2015/03/cub-day-out-3rd-may-2015/" target="new">Cub Day Out</a> where South Met Cubs 
						 can get together for some fun and games.  A <a href="http://www.nswcuboree.com.au/" target="new">Cuboree</a> is held every 3 years 
						 where we can camp with others from around New South Wales.  We go on hikes and learn to abseil, that is, when we're not flying in a light aircraft at the 
						 <a href="http://www.nsw.scouts.com.au/air/" target ="new">Air Activities Centre</a>.
						
						<h3>When and Where?</h3>
						<p>Cubs meet on Wednesday nights during school terms 7:00pm - 8:30pm. Once a term we leave the hall to take the Cubs to an offsite activity, 
						so you might like to contact our Group Leader George Murray (Rama) on 02 9667 1065 to make sure Cubs will be meeting at the hall on the night.</p>
