						<h3>Camper Award Badge</h3>
						<br/>
						<p>The Camper Award Badge depicts the total number of nights spent camping while on approved Scouting activities. (School camps and family holidays don't count.) 
						They may be worn above the pocket of the uniform below the World Badge.</p>
					
						<p>The requirements for the badge can be started at the Joey Scout level and continue to be added through to the Rover Scout section. 
						The number of nights camped can be recorded on Scout Central. Some Record Books also have space to record camps.</p>
					
						<ul>
							<li>Each youth member should commence and maintain their personal log which details the number of nights spent camping and distance covered in hiking/canoeing etc.</li>
							<li>This is an ongoing tally that progresses through all Sections. When a youth member links to the next section, they just keep adding the nights to their log.</li>
							<li>Approval for the badge is via the method of approval for other badges for the section e.g. Leader for Joey Scouts and Cub Scouts or Troop, Unit and Crew Council.</li>
							<li>When a new badge is earned, it replaces the previous badge. Only one badge is to be worn at a time. Once you have reached the maximum number of nights on the highest badge we have, you keep wearing that badge.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Walkabout Award Badge</h3>
						<br/>
						<p>The Walkabout Award Badge is earned for the total kilometres travelled under human power through a youth member's time in Scouting. 
						The minimum distance to be counted toward the tally for Joey Scouts and Cub Scouts is 1km while it is 5kms for all others. Journeys taken in a 
						canoe, kayak, skis or a bicycle are divided by 2 e.g. a 20 km bike hike earns 10 km to the Award. Day and overnight journeys provided they are over the 
						minimum distance for the section, may be included for the Award. The badge may be worn above the pocket of the uniform below the World Badge.</p>

						<p>The requirements for the badge can be started at the Joey Scout level and continue to be added through to the Rover Scout section. These can be 
						recorded on the Scout Central register sheet by your leaders. Some Record Books also have a personal log section.</p>
